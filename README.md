# deep-learning-rnn-tvscript (pytorch, rnn, python, gpu, aws)

TV Script Generation
In this project, we will generate our own Seinfeld TV scripts using RNNs. You'll be using part of the Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons. The Neural Network you'll build will generate a new ,"fake" TV script, based on patterns it recognizes in this training data.

Get the Data
The data is already provided for you in ./data/Seinfeld_Scripts.txt and you're encouraged to open that file and look at the text.

As a first step, we'll load in this data and look at some samples. Then, we'll be tasked with defining and training an RNN to generate a new script!
